At approximately 5:36 a.m. today, the FBI launched a raid of the Heffley household in Plainview, MA, specifically targeting cult leader and international war criminal Manny Heffley. Heffley escaped and is currently fleeing to the Islamic Republic of Iran, where he has been granted political asylum by the Ayatollah.

Investigators found blueprints in Mannyâ€™s room for a nuclear power station capable of producing weapons-grade uranium. The UN has strongly condemned the Iranian government taking in Manny and INTERPOL has issued a warrant for his arrest. Manny was last spotted at Moscow International Airport boarding an Iran Air flight to Tehran.

If you see this man, do not approach him. He is an armed with a frozen Diet Coke condom stolen from his older brother, Rodrick and an extremely dangerous war criminal wanted for committing horrendous atrocities against humanity. Contact your local government immediately so they can send in trained professionals to deal with this menace.
