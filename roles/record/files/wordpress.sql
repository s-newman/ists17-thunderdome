WordPress 5.1 is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-1/\">scheduled to be released</a> on <strong>Thursday, February 21</strong>, but we need <em>your</em> help to get there—if you haven’t tried 5.1 yet, now is the time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to test the WordPress 5.1 release candidate: try the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want to select the “bleeding edge nightlies” option), or you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.1-RC1.zip\">download the release candidate here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What&#8217;s in WordPress 5.1?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspired by Archie Bell &amp; The Drells, WordPress&#8217;s theme for 2019 is to &#8220;tighten up&#8221;, and WordPress 5.1 focussed on exactly that.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\'youtube-player\' type=\'text/html\' width=\'632\' height=\'386\' src=\'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wro3bqi4Eb8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent\' allowfullscreen=\'true\' style=\'border:0;\'></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With security and speed in mind, this release introduces WordPress’s first <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/14/php-site-health-mechanisms-in-5-1/\">Site Health</a> features. WordPress will start showing notices to administrators of sites that run long-outdated versions of PHP, which is the programming language that powers WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, when installing new plugins, WordPress&#8217;s Site Health features will check whether a plugin requires a version of PHP incompatible with your site. If so, WordPress will prevent you from installing that plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new block editor has kept improving since its introduction in WordPress 5.0. Most significantly, WordPress 5.1 includes solid performance improvements within the editor. The editor should feel a little quicker to start, and typing should feel smoother. There are more features and performance improvements planned in upcoming WordPress releases, you can check them out in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg\">Gutenberg plugin</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plugin and Theme Developers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Please test your plugins and themes against WordPress 5.1 and update the <em>Tested up to</em> version in the readme to 5.1. If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a> so we can figure those out before the final release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress 5.1 Field Guide has also been published, which goes into the details of the major changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"vJJstvskLt\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/08/wordpress-5-1-field-guide/\">WordPress 5.1 Field Guide</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/08/wordpress-5-1-field-guide/embed/#?secret=vJJstvskLt\" data-secret=\"vJJstvskLt\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"&#8220;WordPress 5.1 Field Guide&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help us translate WordPress into more than 100 languages!</a> This release also marks the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/glossary/#hard-freeze\">hard string freeze</a>&nbsp;point of the 5.1 release schedule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\">Alpha/Beta area</a>&nbsp;in the support forums.

Someone mentioned the other day how they learned HTML through View Source, and I did that as well, but then it occurred to me that I learned how to do <em>that</em> through WordPerfect&#8217;s &#8220;View Codes.&#8221; Same idea, different platform.</p>\n<p>The college that I went to had a VAX/VMS computer network for the whole campus. Dumb terminals with either green or orange letters hooked up to a computer that was probably five feet tall, eight feet long, and about four feet wide. It could do email so that we could send an Electronic Message all the way across campus!  It was incredible. Then I was told we were going to be connected to The Internet. I remember where I was standing, and who I was talking to when I said the words &#8220;What&#8217;s the Internet?&#8221;</p>\n<p>A year later we got a World Wide Web client installed, called Lynx. It took me a while to figure out why it was better than Gopher, but then I loved it. One day a friend said, &#8220;Hey, look what I made!&#8221; and he had made his own web page. I was floored.  He said, &#8220;You should do it too!&#8221;  I said &#8220;No, I could never figure that out&#8221; to which he responded, &#8220;Sure, let me show you.&#8221;  That right there summarizes how I&#8217;ve tried to treat new people in my profession.</p>\n<p>He showed me how HTML worked, and I learned every single HTML tag in about an hour.  There were only about 30 tags, and the H tags were six of them.</p>\n<p>Within a year people were paying me to build web pages.  (Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://topher1kenobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cornerstone_college_website_lynx.png\">a screenshot of my first paid web gig</a>.)</p>\n<p>I did plain HTML for a number of years. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes\">Server Side Includes</a> came and went. In 1997 someone asked me to build a site with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP#Early_history\">PHP/FI 2.0</a>, so I went home from work, went to <a href=\"http://devshed.com/\">devshed.com</a> and looked up an article on how to do that, thus starting my career as a PHP developer.</p>\n<p>A couple of years later &#8220;cascading style sheets&#8221; looked like they were here to stay and I picked those up and became a &#8220;full stack developer&#8221; though no-one used that phrase back then.  I was a Webmaster.</p>\n<p>When WordPress was first released, I was working at a University, teaching a class on the side for fun.  It was Intro to Web Development. Each student had to do a project, so I decided to take one on as well.  I built a blogging system to compete with WordPress. To my knowledge, one other person used it, ever. But I used it for about ten years. I didn&#8217;t really like WordPress back then because it really WAS &#8220;just for blogging.&#8221; Trying to make it do other things was hard.</p>\n<p>But then came WordPress 3.0 with Custom Post Types, and everything changed. WordPress morphed into a real CMS with that one version.</p>\n<p>In 2010 I went freelance (on purpose!) about the same time 3.0 came out, and I immediately started using it, and haven&#8217;t really used anything else since.</p>\n<p><strong>DK: I&#8217;m curious, how did you come by the nickname &#8220;Topher?&#8221; Is there a good story there?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TD:</strong> When I was three, my Aunt was babysitting, and she asked me if I knew what my middle name was.  I knew my first name was Chris, last name DeRosia, and full name Christopher DeRosia, so I assumed Topher was my middle name. She laughed and wrote it on the fridge notebook and called my Grandma etc. I still have the paper she wrote it on. People called me Topher very occasionally until college when there were four Chris&#8217; on my dorm floor. We each picked something, and I&#8217;ve been 100% Topher ever since. When I was young and vain, I considered making it a mononym, but&#8230; such a nerd.</p>\n<p><strong>DK: What have you learned from HeroPress over time? Did it surprise you in any way, what people had to say? What do you think about people and groups on the &#8220;fringe&#8221; of the WordPress community today? Who/what are we (North Americans) least attentive to/aware of?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TD:</strong> I read your question about what I&#8217;ve learned from HeroPress over time and then sat in my chair for a good ten minutes just thinking about everything. HeroPress has become so pervasive in my personal relationships with people that it&#8217;s hard for me to separate these days. I never thought I would be such close friends with people so far away. People I laugh with, cry with, talk long into the night, have days-long conversations on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Most times when I approach someone about being a contributor I have some idea of their background, so while surprises happen they&#8217;re not usually too big. One time that really blew my mind though was at WCUS in Philly. A speaker looked like a good candidate, and so without knowing anything about her, I approached her in the hall and introduced myself. I asked if I could tell her about my project, HeroPress, and she agreed.  About 20 seconds into my pitch she started sobbing. Deeply and loudly. I was literally speechless. As it turns out she had a story that needed to be told, a story that started with a family leaving her country of origin when she was very young, and all the things that happened to her after that. I cried then with her, and I&#8217;m crying a little bit now as I write it. I will always say that HeroPress has affected me personally more than anyone else in the world.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned that people are diverse, so I can&#8217;t say anyone is like X or wants Y because of my perception of where they live. Some poor people want money.  Some don&#8217;t. Some people want freedom. Some never think about it. It doesn&#8217;t matter where they live or what they have; I can never assume about them.</p>\n<p>I have noticed that wealthier people tend to forget they&#8217;re wealthy and take it for granted. They usually don&#8217;t feel wealthy. One WordPress person might say &#8220;I&#8217;m a little short on cash this year, I&#8217;ll only go to one WordCamp.&#8221;  Another WordPress person might say &#8220;I wish attending WordCamp didn&#8217;t cost two years salary.&#8221; Or perhaps &#8220;I wish people I don&#8217;t know didn&#8217;t think I was a terrorist, so I could go learn.&#8221; I feel so flippant sometimes. I want to learn something, so I spend $100 on an online class. My friend wants to learn the same thing, and $100 is six months salary. Even in wealthy nations like America, where our poorest are among the richest internationally, WordCamp is a couple of months rent, or gas, or electricity.</p>\n<p>I could write for a long time, but it has been impressed upon me the difference in life choices between the haves and the have nots.</p>\n<p><strong>DK: How do you look at your freelance career now? What kind of work did you do? And how did that path lead to Sandhills, Modern Tribe, and now BigCommerce?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TD:</strong> I started freelancing in college, though I didn&#8217;t know that&#8217;s what it was called, or even that people actually did it for a living. I was just picking up odd jobs. After I graduated, rather than get a Real Job, I just kept taking contracts. A few months after graduation I took a three-month contract with Kellogg&#8217;s and built their first intranet web site. Netscape 3 was the hotness at the time.</p>\n<p>After that, I took a real job at a hosting company of sorts, and I was there until 2000 when I took a job at my old university running their radio station websites for ten years.  I never quit freelancing on the side though. Always there was someone emailing me saying &#8220;Hey, my brother&#8217;s wife&#8217;s uncle&#8217;s nephew says you do internet. Can you help?&#8221; Or worse &#8220;Hi there, someone told me you know web stuff, my username and password are *****. Can you help?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Over Christmas break in 2009, my wife and I were talking, and I realized I had spent all of every evening working on side work for two years <em>solid</em>. I was spending eight hours a day at work making $25/hr (granted, with benefits etc.) and three hours every evening making $65/hr. We reasoned that if I got that day job out of the way and managed four billable hours a day, we&#8217;d be in about the same position.  Except I wouldn&#8217;t be at the office eight hours a day (nine if you include driving) and I&#8217;d get my evenings back.  What&#8217;s not to like? <a href=\"https://topher1kenobe.com/freelance-freedom/\">So in February 2010, I was done</a>.</p>\n<p>People often ask me &#8220;How do you know when it&#8217;s time to freelance?&#8221; The answer is, start now, on the side.  When you&#8217;re making enough that the day job is getting in the way, fire it.</p>\n<p>As for what kind of work I did, there&#8217;s some irony. Before 2010 I did all custom PHP/MySQL/HTML/CSS stuff. 2010 is when WordPress 3.0 came out and changed everything. I did only WordPress after that. So the metric I had based my freelance career on changed as soon as I started full time.  But it worked out.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t very good with WordPress when I started, but I was a very good PHP dev, so I quickly learned how to mess with custom post types. Most implementors didn&#8217;t know how but needed them, so I did a <i>lot</i> of work for other WordPress devs. I would say the majority of my freelance work since 2010 has been building doodads for other WordPress developers, as opposed to building websites.</p>\n<p>Somewhere around 2011, a client talked me into joining their startup. I become CTO, and it was sort of a Real Job.  Then we took investment and became a really Real Job. <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/varsity-news-network\">Varsity News Network</a> is still going today. While there I built a monolithic plugin that did everything I could think of — it was ridiculous.  It was my first plugin, and it showed. It was decently secure and whatnot, but I didn&#8217;t fully understand hooks and filters, and the whole thing was a bit of a mess.  But who doesn&#8217;t look at their code from eight years ago and cringe?</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t really enjoy my time there, and my partner knew it, so in the summer of 2013 he took me out to breakfast and fired me. It was awkward because that meant I didn&#8217;t have a job or insurance anymore, but he was right, I didn&#8217;t want to be there. It also meant I had to go tell my wife that we were out of work.</p>\n<p>There were some upsides, however. My partner went to bat for me with the board and got me my stock options, without having to work six more months to vest them. Also, there was a New Thing in the WordPress world: agencies. I&#8217;d been hearing about one called 10up, and I knew there were others. By this time I knew some people in the WordPress world, and I felt pretty confident I could get a job fast. I emailed a friend at 10up, and he said, &#8220;You need to talk to Jake.&#8221; So a few minutes later I was talking Jake at 10up.  He gave me some advice and gave me a test to take to see if I&#8217;d fit in there. I&#8217;m going to skip ahead here, because the next few months are an interesting story in and of themselves, and it would make this tome even more epic.</p>\n<p>Long story short, <a href=\"https://topher1kenobe.com/new-job/\">I started a trial with X-Team in November of 2013</a> and went full time in January. I worked there until the fall of 2013 when Dave Rosen, the owner of X-Team/XWP approached me about <a href=\"https://heropress.com/about/\">starting HeroPress</a>. HeroPress took about four months to fail, and during that time several people approached me and said &#8220;If this doesn&#8217;t work out, come see me,&#8221; which was a very nice safety net.</p>\n<p>Of course, it did fail. <a href=\"https://topher1kenobe.com/moving-forward/\">I went and saw Pippin Williamson</a> and worked for him writing docs for about a year and a half. In the spring of 2016, I wasn&#8217;t very happy writing docs. Pippin was great, the company was great, but I just didn&#8217;t fit well. I heard Peter Chester from Modern Tribe talk about how they work, and getting back to coding sounded like just the thing to me. <a href=\"https://topher1kenobe.com/a-new-job-at-modern-tribe/\">I worked there for about five months</a>. Some miscommunication during hiring put me in a position I was ill-suited for, and it wasn&#8217;t good for either of us.</p>\n<p>After that, <a href=\"https://topher1kenobe.com/a-grand-experiment/\">I joined with Tanner Moushey for about a year</a> to spin up a WordPress agency. In typical startup fashion it was a lot of hard work and not quite enough pay for either of us, so we ended that at the beginning of 2018, and I had to decide what I wanted to do next.</p>\n<p>I freelanced for about six months. What I really wanted was a community job — something where I did a lot of shaking hands and kissing babies.</p>\n<p>Then at 11:33 PM on June 11th, my friend Luke sent me this in Slack:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54974\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/topher-sms.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1294\" height=\"152\" /></p>\n<p>This may come as a surprise to you, but I WAS interested. A week later they made an offer, and I accepted. <a href=\"https://topher1kenobe.com/a-dream-job/\">I started at BigCommerce on my birthday, 17 July</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>DK: So do you get to do a lot of shaking hands and kissing babies as a WordPress Developer Evangelist?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TD:</strong> A lot of shaking hands, not too many babies yet, which is sad, I love babies.  <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> I&#8217;ve been tasked with going to twenty WordCamps in 2019, and I travel in person to at least one Meetup per month. On top of that, I spend a ton of time talking with people on Slack, Twitter, Hangouts, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>DK: Tell us about the good news of headless eCommerce.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TD:</strong> The joys of headless eCommerce are many.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You build the presentation layer of your store in whatever language you&#8217;re most comfortable with. With a good enough API, the language really doesn&#8217;t matter. PHP, .Net, React, Rails, whatever you want. If you change your mind two years later, fine, your store is all still there with everything important still configured.</li>\n<li>It makes your website much more modular. By this, I mean that you can build a website and connect it to your store.  Then you can build <em>another</em> website and also connect it to your store.  Then a mobile app. Then Amazon, or eBay, or Facebook.</li>\n<li>It leaves the hardest parts of eCommerce to people who do nothing else but that. They know all the intricacies of PCI compliance, they have entire teams dedicated to security, and there&#8217;s 24/7 support</li>\n<li>A SaaS typically has quite a bit of leverage with third-party services like shippers and credit card processors. This means they can not only get solid integrations but also at prices you can afford. For example, BigCommerce has a deal with Braintree to offer the lowest PayPal rates anywhere. A SaaS has the power of volume when negotiating on your behalf with third-party services.  There&#8217;s huge value in that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>DK: Is BigCommerce unique in the WordPress space?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TD:</strong> Depends on how you define it.  <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />  There are other eCommerce plugins, and there are other SaaS plugins.  There&#8217;s even a Shopify plugin that works over API just like BigCommerce. That said, Shopify&#8217;s API handles two requests per second out of the box, whereas BigCommerce&#8217;s does 400 per second.  I think if you want to look at the purely SaaS angle, plugins like OptinMonster and Kraken.io started the movement.  I think larger companies like BigCommerce are going to help turn the tide toward heavy SaaSification (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/1084887261471072257\">that&#8217;s a @Mor10 term</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>DK: Are developers or site owners hesitant to move inventory to an API-first service where pricing is based on fixed API call limits?  Or is this what the future of WordPress looks like, as a Digital Experience Platform?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TD:</strong> We haven&#8217;t seen that with the developers who use our platform most. The most traffic we&#8217;ve ever gotten is a small fraction of what our theoretical limits are on the API, so there hasn&#8217;t been any concern there. Mostly what we&#8217;ve seen is excitement about being able to break out of our built-in Stencil framework and build without limits, while keeping the core power of the eCommerce platform. (Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://firewiresurfboards.com/\">a simple example</a>.) There&#8217;s a simple form where you can put in your weight and skill level, and it will tell you your surfboard volume. In WordPress, that&#8217;s ridiculously simple, but in Stencil, on BigCommerce it would be really hard.  Putting WordPress on the front end of BigCommerce gives the benefits of both platforms.</p>\n<p>Something that has really surprised me is the excitement of agencies that have been working in Stencil on BigCommerce for years. Most of them also do WordPress sites, and they are <em>thrilled</em> at the possibilities. I know of more than one agency that is giving up all other eCommerce options (like Magento or Shopify) to go exclusively BigCommerce on WordPress. It&#8217;s very exciting.</p>\n<p><strong>DK: What do you do when you&#8217;re not working to relax or to decompress when you&#8217;re off work?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TD:</strong> I typically spend time with my family watching TV or playing games. I do have a personal vice; I play a few video games. I don&#8217;t consider myself a gamer, but there are a few I like, and I&#8217;ll occasionally take a few hours in the evening and play. <img src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-logo-blue-192x192.png\" width=\"16px\" height=\"16px\" /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 22:30:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"WPTavern: Amazon Introduces Blog Blueprint to Deliver WordPress Posts as Audio on Alexa\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=87304\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/amazon-introduces-blog-blueprint-to-deliver-wordpress-posts-as-audio-on-alexa\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4232:\"<p>Last week Amazon launched <a href=\"https://blueprints.amazon.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alexa Skill Blueprints</a> that allow anyone to publish new skills to the Alexa Skills Store without having to have any coding knowledge. The blueprints are templates that provide a starting point where users can create a new skill by filling in the blanks and then publish it to the store for US customers. </p>\n<p>This first round of blueprints is targeted at content creators, bloggers, and organizations. It includes blueprints for personal trainers, flashcards, facts, quizzes, and a fable blueprint for storytellers. There are also new blueprints available called University and Spiritual Talks for live and recorded audio content from institutions and organizations.</p>\n<p>Amazon has also created a blueprint specifically for WordPress blogs. It works in connection with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-polly/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon AI Plugin for WordPress</a> to read blogs aloud on Alexa-enabled devices. Setup is not trivial but it is much easier for users than having to create their own blueprints from scratch.</p>\n<h3>How to Get Alexa to Read Your WordPress Blog Aloud</h3>\n<p>According to Amazon&#8217;s announcement, the new <a href=\"https://blueprints.amazon.com/bp/amzn.ask.bp.560100e2-ff88-496b-846c-6fb44445d5d0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress blog blueprint</a> converts posts into speech and creates an audio RSS feed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Amazon AI Plugin for WordPress is a sample application that enables WordPress bloggers to easily convert their blog posts into speech by leveraging Text-to-Speech (TTS) and translation tools provided by Amazon. Bloggers can generate an audio feed (RSS feed) for text-based blog content, and simply add this to the new Blog blueprint to create and publish their own Alexa skill.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you want to get this working for your WordPress blog, the first step is to install the official <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-polly/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon AI Plugin for WordPress</a>. Follow the instructions on the <a href=\"https://blueprints.amazon.com/bp/amzn.ask.bp.560100e2-ff88-496b-846c-6fb44445d5d0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Blog skill blueprint</a> page. The plugin will generate an RSS feed that you will enter into your skill content section. It also needs to be configured with the AWS access key, secret key, and AWS region. There are options available for specifying a post type, enable logging, audio player settings, the ability to exclude certain tags from generating audio, translations, audio excerpts, and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/amazon-plugin-for-wp.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>After setting up the plugin, you can complete the blueprint by customizing the welcome messages, naming the skill, and publishing it to the Alexa Skills Store, as demonstrated in the video below. Anyone with an Alexa-enabled device can then have Alexa read your RSS feed to them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Amazon also introduced a new blueprint for creating flash briefing skills, which include short-form content in the form of an audio feed. This format lends itself well to local weather reports, news and sports updates, and other information that can be quickly communicated via an audio update. This may be another option that WordPress news site owners may want to consider. The <a href=\"https://blueprints.amazon.com/bp/amzn.ask.bp.0758a769-9b10-4089-9679-1791ee6bfa5f\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">flash briefing skills</a> page has instructions for creating one and there is also an unofficial WordPress plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-alexa-flash-briefing/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WP Alexa Flash Briefing</a> that has its own Alexa skill already set up.</p>\n<p>If you want to go one step further and manage your WordPress blog with Alexa, the Blog Helper skill will enable you to log new drafts and moderate comments.

Here&#039;s why a \"distributed\" workforce is better for business — and employees:</p>\n<p>Posted by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TEDsTheWayWeWork/\">The Way We Work</a> on Monday, January 14, 2019</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>When I first started working as a developer from home in 2008, many of my friends and family didn&#8217;t believe I had &#8220;a real job.&#8221; People would often say things like, &#8220;Remind me what it is that you do at home all day&#8230;?&#8221; Sometimes I would even receive honest questions from incredulous friends, asking, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go find a real job?&#8221; The culture of remote and distributed work is still not widely understood 11 years later but it is slowly improving.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think a distributed work force is the most effective way to build a company,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;The key is that you have to approach it consciously. I believe that talent and intelligence are equally distributed throughout the world but opportunity is not.&#8221; Large tech companies, along with more traditional style companies, still struggle to get on board with this way of working. </p>\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s TED talk explains a few advantages of distributed work. He also anticipates responses from managers in traditional work environments, who might say, &#8220;Sure, that may work for all you fancy tech folks but not for us.&#8221; Mullenweg outlines a few tips for getting started, such as documenting everything, increasing communication online, and experimenting with collaboration tools. </p>\n<p>Automattic was the first WordPress company to operate a completely distributed workforce. Many other product companies, hosts, and agencies have followed suit. Remote and distributed teams have now become so common in the WordPress ecosystem that many who have experienced this way of working can never return to their old way of life.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 19:02:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: WPBrigade Patches Critical Vulnerability in Simple Social Buttons Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=87279\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/wpbrigade-patches-critical-vulnerability-in-simple-social-buttons-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1750:\"<p><a href=\"https://wpbrigade.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WPBrigade</a>, the developers behind the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-social-buttons/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Simple Social Buttons</a> plugin, have patched a critical privilege escalation vulnerability.

The collection has since doubled in size, adding features like accordions, social sharing buttons, tabbed content, a progress bar, and star-ratings. Many block collections are loosely organized around serving a specific user demographic. This one is aimed at bloggers and marketers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimate Blocks&#8217; latest release includes Reviews, a new Gutenberg block that is unique to this plugin. It allows users to easily add rows of review criteria and will automatically calculate the cumulative star rating. Users can also edit the title of the review, author name, review summary, and call-to-action button.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most interesting features of the plugin is that it is schema-enabled, which means that the reviews use a standard <a href=\"https://schema.org/\">schema for structured data</a> that can be easily read by applications like Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, and others. For example, when Google finds a schema-enabled review, it can display it as a rich <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/review-snippet\">review snippet</a> with stars and other summary info. These snippets may appear in search results or in Google Knowledge Cards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to clarify that this block is for the site owner to write their own reviews. It&#8217;s not a block that adds a frontend form for visitors to leave reviews. It&#8217;s more useful for site owners who want a nice way to display their own reviews for books, movies, restaurants, or any other type of information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After testing the plugin, I was impressed by how the star rating calculations all work live inside Gutenberg while setting up the block. The back and frontend styles also match fairly well. The Reviews block is generic enough to be used for virtually any type of review a user wants to display. It would even more useful if the author expanded it to support frontend review submissions, which would allow users to create their own community review sites. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 20:34:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:108:\"WPTavern: Speaker Applications Now Open for 2nd Annual JavaScript for WordPress Conference, July 11-13, 2019\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=87220\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"https://wptavern.com/speaker-applications-now-open-for-2nd-annual-javascript-for-wordpress-conference-july-11-13-2019\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2477:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/JS-for-WP-conf-2019.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Last year Zac Gordon organized a free virtual <a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/conference/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript for WordPress conference</a> and the event drew 1,200 live attendees. With attendance numbers higher than most WordPress conferences and hundreds more views on the videos published afterwards, Gordon considered it a success and committed to organize another event this year.</p>\n<p>The next edition is set for July 11-13, 2019, and has been expanded to feature three free days of talks, workshops, and contribution focused on JavaScript and WordPress. The goal for the event&#8217;s contributor day is to improve Gutenberg documentation. Applications for speakers and sponsors are now open and attendees can reserve their seats by signing up on the event&#8217;s <a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/conference/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The conference aims to cover intermediate and advanced topics (not so much beginner),&#8221; Gordon said. &#8220;Most of the talks are about latest trends of how JS and WP can be used together. Accessibility is really important, as is diversity in speakers. I&#8217;d love to have more folks share about cool things they do at work.&#8221; He said topics like headless WP, Gatsby, React, state management, Gutenberg, and blockchain are a few examples that seem to be popular in this space right now. Testing and internationalization are two topics that still need speakers.</p>\n<p>Gordon teaches both beginner and more advanced <a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">courses</a> on JavaScript and Gutenberg development, giving him a unique window into the landscape of JavaScript education. After Gutenberg made its way into core, Gordon said folks &#8220;finally have a tangible reason to learn JavaScript.&#8221; </p>\n<p>&#8220;Also, I think folks are finding it easier than first thought,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A lot of folks have taken my Gutenberg Development Course with zero React or tooling experience and that served as a good introduction to it all.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At first Matt said, &#8216;Learn JavaScript Deeply.&#8217; But at the last WCUS he said, &#8216;Learn Blocks Deeply.&#8217; Luckily, I think it is becoming easier to learn what we need to know with JS and React and tools to get by.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 03:39:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Nordic to Host Workshop for Kids on March 7\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=87229\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-nordic-to-host-workshop-for-kids-on-march-7\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4786:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kids-workshop-belgrade.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: Ivan Gatić</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://2019.nordic.wordcamp.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Nordic</a>, a new regional WordCamp taking place in Helsinki, is just 23 days away.

Attendees will learn how to set up their own WordPress websites, choose a theme, and learn how to add text, galleries, videos, and other elements to the their sites.</p>\n<p>WordPress veteran Petya Raykovska is leading the kids&#8217; workshop. She has <a href=\"http://petya.in/wordpress-workshop-for-kids-an-organiser-kit/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">led similar workshops all over the world</a>, first in Bangkok 2017, followed by events in Belgrade, Sofia, Varna, and other locations. Demand for the kids&#8217; workshops has grown in the past two years and Raykovska started receiving requests from other European WordCamp organizers to lead events at their camps. As a result, she has created an <a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/WordPress-Workshop-for-Kids-organiser-kit-kxmOjjycWysa3jFYoaBTv\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">organizer kit</a> for others wanting to host their own WordPress workshops for kids.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thank you to all the kids workshop volunteers at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCSOF?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCSOF</a> and to all the kids who created their first <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> sites today.

Facebook (and soon to be Snapchat) is widely regarded as an &#8220;app for old people&#8221; and its <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/facebook-officially-old-people-803196\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">users under the age of 24 are rapidly declining</a>. WordPress is in a better position, because an influx of older users doesn&#8217;t affect the overall experience of the app the same way. However, if WordPress usage isn&#8217;t growing among the school age population, it is in danger of suffering the same fate as Facebook &#8211; becoming an application that will live and die with its current generation of users. Onboarding new young WordPressers doesn&#8217;t just help to ensure the software&#8217;s future but it also gives kids a tool that can help them find their place on the open web, a home for their content that will outlast all the ephemeral social networking apps. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 23:38:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg Blocks Design Library Offers Pre-Built Page Designs Using Existing Core Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=87200\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-blocks-design-library-offers-pre-built-page-designs-using-existing-core-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2845:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/design/\">Gutenberg Blocks Design Library</a> is a new plugin that provides pre-built page designs, including demo content, using only the default core blocks that come with WordPress. The free version comes with 50 different designs that users can import from the growing Gutenberg Blocks Design Library. These include simple designs for all kinds of page building items, such as text with images, columns with headers, call-to-action sections, team member listings, testimonials, contact page layouts, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is fully compatible with other Gutenberg themes and plugins, since it simply adds styles to existing core blocks. It can be used in combination with block collections, such as Atomic Blocks, Editor Blocks, CoBlocks, Caxton, Kadence, GhostKit, WooCommerce blocks, and many others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few major advantages to this approach. Simply adding styles to core blocks means that the plugin doesn&#8217;t introduce a bunch of new blocks for users to scroll through in the block inserter. It also ensures data portability. If a user ends up deactivating and removing the plugin for any reason, the content is still there in the default block design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Gutenberg Blocks Design Library is compatible with any WordPress theme that works with the new editor, the appearance of the the pre-made designs vary somewhat across themes. I tested various blocks with different themes and found that it seems to adapt to the active theme&#8217;s look and feel. This can be a positive feature or a negative one if the user is hoping for the designs to match the demo exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After installing the plugin, the design library is available by toggling the carrot icon in the menu at the top of the editor. The user is then prompted to import 50 free designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The creators of the Gutenberg Blocks Design Library have also built a commercial subscription service to sell &#8220;<a href=\"https://wpdesignhub.com/pro/\">pro designs</a>.&#8221; Pricing during the beta period starts at $9/year for a single site.  The company aims to have 1,000 commercial designs available to subscribers by November 2019.

The organization has been instrumental in combatting issues caused by license proliferation, as many open source licenses cannot be legally combined and this can be detrimental to the open source ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The affirmation published this week explains the need for a standard definition of open source: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Without this single, standard definition of &#8220;open source,&#8221; software development as we know it would not be possible. There is no trust in a world where anyone can invent their own definition for open source, and without trust there is no community, no collaboration, and no innovation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Recent controversy surrounding Redis Labs licensing some of its modules under the <a href=\"https://redislabs.com/community/commons-clause/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apache 2.0 modified with a Commons Clause</a> has highlighted the need for an authoritative definition of open source. Salil Deshpande, who helped create the Commons Clause (written by open-source lawyer <a href=\"https://heathermeeker.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Heather Meeker</a>), wrote an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/29/the-crusade-against-open-source-abuse/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> for TechCrunch two months ago about how he perceives large cloud infrastructure providers, such as AWS in this case, to be a threat to the viability of open source. He explained why he and collaborators commissioned the Commons Clause:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We wished to define a license that prevents cloud infrastructure providers from running certain software as a commercial service, while at the same time making that software effectively open source for everyone else, i.e. everyone not running that software as a commercial service.</p>\n<p>With our first proposal, Commons Clause, we took the most straightforward approach: we constructed one clause, which can be added to any liberal open-source license, preventing the licensee from “Selling” the software  —  where “Selling” includes running it as a commercial service. (Selling other software made with Commons Clause software is allowed, of course.) Applying Commons Clause transitions a project from open source to source-available.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In referencing MongoDB&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Server Side Public License (SSPL)</a>, Deshpande questioned the authority and relevance of OSI:</p>\n<blockquote><p>OSI, which has somehow anointed itself as the body that will “decide” whether a license is open source, has a habit of myopically debating what’s open source and what’s not. With the submission of SSPL to OSI, MongoDB has put the ball in OSI’s court to either step up and help solve an industry problem, or put their heads back in the sand.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Commons Clause, which has no chance of being approved by OSI, was a reaction to cloud-based services making a profit from open source software without contributing much back to the software&#8217;s creators. This is a common issue encountered by maintainers of popular open source projects. However, the Commons Clause isn&#8217;t a good solution for this problem, because it effectively neuters open source software, removing the vital freedoms identified in the open source definition, including free distribution and no discrimination against a specific field of endeavor. OSI President Simon Phipps called the Commons Clause an &#8220;abrogation of software freedom&#8221; after Redis changed its license.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Redis just went proprietary, which sucks.<a href=\"https://t.co/CfIN99Cz5q\">https://t.co/CfIN99Cz5q</a></p>\n<p>No, this is not just \"a limitation concerning fair use\", it is an abrogation of software freedom.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Simon Phipps (@webmink) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/webmink/status/1032016976170967040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 21, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>In light of these recent conversations, OSI is calling organizations to band together in recognition of its authority to maintain a single, standard definition of open source:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Recently there have been efforts to undermine the integrity of open source by claiming there is no need for a single, authoritative definition. These efforts are motivated by the interests of a few rather than the benefit of all, and are at odds with the principles that have so demonstratively served us  well in the past decades. If allowed to continue, these efforts will erode the trust of both users and contributors, and hinder the innovation that is enabled by open source software, just as surely as having multiple definitions of a kilogram would erode and undermine commerce.</p></blockquote>\n<p>OSI reached out first to its <a href=\"https://opensource.org/affiliates\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Affiliate Members</a>, which includes the WordPress open source project, but not all members have responded in time for the publication of the post this week.

I got some really upsetting tweets. After that it started focusing on #yoastcon. It seems like they want to show the hypocrisy in our statements about women. I never spoke at SEO events before, though I have been to SEOktoberfest. It felt totally welcoming back then. That being said, the pictures and movies aren’t something I particularly enjoy watching. I do think they&#8217;re bad, but also a bit out of context. The environment at Yoast is nothing like that. And although my husband likes to party (as do I), I feel he’s always been a strong believer in equal rights and opportunities. I think we all make mistakes and learn from them. At Yoast, we’re really trying to improve inequality with both the diversity fund and my empowerment project.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For those watching the #yoastcon hashtag, the way the situation unfolded it almost seemed like a coordinated personal attack on de Valk, especially given how the SEOktoberfest videos were spliced together with the YoastCon promotional videos. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/explorionary\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">David Cohen</a>, a Philadelphia-based Digital Marketing Director who previously worked at a large SEO agency, started the conversation by publishing de Valk&#8217;s old tweets that he had found years ago when researching Yoast and its founder.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As far as the tweets from Joost are concerned, I&#8217;ve known about them since 2014,&#8221; Cohen said. &#8220;I just never knew what to do with them or how to proceed questioning why that behavior was perfectly acceptable for him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As far as the harassment and abuse in the SEO industry, particularly at the SEO conferences, I&#8217;ve known about this since 2011 after seeing it firsthand while working at a large SEO agency in Philly, Seer Interactive.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cohen said that he began publicly criticizing people he calls &#8220;SEO celebs&#8221; in 2014, for &#8220;saying they are against the SEO harassment and abuse, claiming to be &#8216;male feminists,&#8217; yet knowingly covering up the abuse and enabling the abusers who happen to also be their friends, peers, colleagues, etc.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While the discussion on the #yoastcon hashtag seems centered around de Valk&#8217;s admitted indiscretions, Cohen said his objective in publicizing the old tweets goes beyond de Valk. He&#8217;s calling out other leaders in the industry who he alleges have harassed and abused women for years. </p>\n<p>&#8220;This started a solo mission to take action as a messenger of questions for the group of SEOs most prominent figures who hold the power of influence over the industry about the 10+ year ongoing issue of alleged harassment and abuse of women in the SEO world, particularly at SEO conferences between 2009 and 2012 era.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cohen said the timing with YoastCon was &#8220;a mission looking for direct and public answers on this topic once and for all while they were all gathered together at the event.&#8221; He began tweeting about these issues well before the event and was using the #yoastcon hashtag to call out other SEO industry leaders for the past few months. </p>\n<p>When asked about his motive, Cohen said he simply wants answers from de Valk, Rand Fishkin, his wife Geraldine, John Doherty, Martin MacDonald, Marcus Tandler, and others regarding what he perceives to be hypocrisy in the SEO industry.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why has it been totally cool for the SEO celebs, rock stars, ninjas, and conference speakers to be misogynists, to objectify and sexualize women, to hire Playmates for their SEO events, and to engage in behavior that would easily be classified as &#8216;toxic masculinity?\'&#8221; Cohen said. He claims that industry leaders have been covering up harassment and abuse that they have known about and have refused to help the women who have been abused. Cohen and several others who have been circulating the tweets claim that victims of this abuse have been contacting them to share their stories but have not yet gone public with them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I chose to act on this now because I wanted answers to two questions from specific people: 1. Do you know of alleged harassment or abuse because someone went to you directly and told their story? And if so, did you refuse to use your power and influence to help them at the risk of your own professional and personal interests?&#8221; Cohen said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As for Joost, going with the &#8216;if I offended anyone&#8217; apology approach is empty and lacks personal accountability for behaviors that are completely misaligned with words. He had to respond publicly. But the question remains open &#8211; why?&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 08 Feb 2019 04:42:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 5.1 Release Candidate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6577\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/02/wordpress-5-1-release-candidate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3950:\"<p>The first release candidate for WordPress 5.1 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an important milestone, as the release date for WordPress 5.1 draws near. &#8220;Release Candidate&#8221; means that the new version is ready for release, but with millions of users and thousands of plugins and themes, it’s possible something was missed.

Riad Benguella, the project&#8217;s technical lead for phase 2, published a demo of the block and its settings. Users can set the number of items displayed and also toggle on/off the author, date, and excerpt.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rss-block.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>RSS is still relevant today as one of the linchpins of the open web and Gutenberg makes it possible to easily place a feed inside a post or page. (This feature was previously limited to widgetized areas.) The creation of this block is part of a larger effort to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">port all of WordPress&#8217; existing core widgets over to blocks</a>.</p>\n<p>Version 5.0 also introduces a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/13510\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Kindle embed block</a>, providing an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=13489836011\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">instant preview</a> from an Amazon Kindle URL. WordPress already has oembed support of Amazon Kindle URLs but it was missing from the Embeds section of the accordion in the block inserter.</p>\n<p>One of the most exciting additions in this release is a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/10925\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FocalPointPicker for the Cover block</a>. It allows users to visually select the ideal center point of an image and returns it as a pair of coordinates that are converted into &#8216;background-position&#8217; attributes. The result is that the user has more control over how the image is cropped. This feature solves so many problems users have experienced in cropping and displaying images in their WordPress themes and content. The FocalPointPicker was created as a reusable component so that developers can use it to build other blocks with the same capabilities, providing an experience that is consistent with core.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cV33J4yy5Il\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/cldup.com/aJ-h5zq4wa.gif?resize=627%2C423&ssl=1\" alt=\"Focal point picker\" width=\"627\" height=\"423\" /></a></p>\n<p>The changes included in Gutenberg 5.0 are immediately available for those running the plugin on their sites but only for WordPress 5.0+. This release drops support for earlier versions of WordPress. The updates in Gutenberg 5.0 are planned to be rolled into WordPress 5.2.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 07 Feb 2019 18:32:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"Post Status: Building Multidots, with Anil Gupta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=55213\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://poststatus.com/building-multidots-with-anil-gupta/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1562:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

I know we are all stereotyped as scammers and thieves but trust me, a lot of us own and operate legit (online) businesses. Just like in every country, there are good and bad people and we are no exception.</p>\n<p>I had a great childhood. Everything was fine and rosy until I lost my Dad which meant I had to shoulder the responsibility of my family as the first child. I manage to finish secondary school and was awarded the best Math student.</p>\n<h3>Introduction to The Internet / Web</h3>\n<p>Back then in secondary school, I had a rich friend who owned a Nokia phone (that could browse the internet) he brings to class which he uses to play games and do fun stuff online even though we weren’t allowed to bring nor use a phone in the class. (Funny right? :D)</p>\n<p>I have always been a football lover (called soccer in the U.S). I still play very well and support Chelsea FC. So each time I have the opportunity to use his phone, I always visit Goal.com to read football news especially concerning my team Chelsea FC of England.</p>\n<p>Being a very inquisitive person, I wanted to learn how the web works as well as have my own website. I was able to buy a Nokia 3120 classic phone via the menial jobs I did after school.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2681\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img2.jpg\" alt=\"Nokia 3120\" width=\"413\" height=\"500\" /></p>\n<p>I visited Google and search how to create my <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol\">wapsite</a>. We refer to mobile phones optimized sites as “wapsite”. The result of my search were filled with site builders like xtgem.com and wapzan.com.</p>\n<p>I chose the xtgem.com and discovered I needed an email address to sign up. Didn’t know what that means so I googled it and eventually created a Yahoo email address. Finally registered and built my first website. Sadly, the site is no longer online but I was able to get a screenshot of the site thanks to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/\">Wayback Machine</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2680\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img1-786x1024.png\" alt=\"WAPsite built by Collins\" width=\"786\" height=\"1024\" /></p>\n<p>I had to learn HTML and CSS from <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/\">w3schools</a> to build the site and it came out well didn’t it?</p>\n<p>I later moved on to wapka.mobi site builder which allows you to build dynamic websites such as a social network or forum using its own programming language called “wapka tags”. I was able to build a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120915021200/http:/www.wapden.net:80/index.html\">community/forum</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20121211011719/http:/www.smsbag.tk:80/index.html\">sms collection</a> and a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20121029021153/http:/www.wapbooks.tk:80/index.html\">file sharing</a> site.</p>\n<p>I later came across <a href=\"http://www.simplemachines.org/\">simple machine forum</a> and <a href=\"https://mybb.com/\">MyBB</a>, I learned them deeply and used them to build forums and community sites for interested people.</p>\n<h3>Meeting WordPress</h3>\n<p>I came across a Facebook group called BloggersLab and discovered I could make money blogging. Two prominent platform at the time to create a blog was Blogger.com and WordPress. I chose WordPress because WordPress blogs were always pretty.</p>\n<p>From my savings, I bought the cheapest hosting plan from a local web hosting here in Nigeria and installed WordPress using Softaculous included in cPanel and started writing wapka.mobi tutorials. See <a href=\"https://w3guy.com/?s=wapka\">https://w3guy.com/?s=wapka</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I did all this with my Nokia phone.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here’s how I publish a new post: first I write it on a notebook before publishing on my blog. I was also building mobile sites for people for small amount of money.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t go to the university because of my precarious financial situation. I continue to do menial jobs during the day and started learning PHP in the evenings and at night using my mobile phone via w3schools.com. I later was able to get a cheap old IBM Thinkpad laptop which I used in getting eBooks from torrent sites because I couldn’t afford them at the time and also to practice coding. Mind you, I was also blogging about the stuff I was learning on w3guy.com</p>\n<p>I later took up a job teaching children at a school primarily because I got tired of the menial jobs and wanted to earn enough to take care of my internet data plan. After a while, I became fairly proficient in PHP and even took up a job to build a school management system which was really slow and ugly.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Saved My Life</h3>\n<p>I needed to start making money with the PHP, HTML &amp; CSS skill I had because my blog wasn’t making any money via AdSense. I think I got to the $100 payout on my second year of blogging.</p>\n<p>I came across a post on Sitepoint.com that they were looking for writers. I applied and got in. I started writing PHP and WordPress development tutorials and got paid few hundreds of dollars per article. In Nigeria, that’s quite a lot of money. I was able to improve the life and well-being of my family and I. I also wrote for Smashing Magazine, Designmodo, Tuts+ and Hongkiat.</p>\n<p>I later got admission into a polytechnic to study computer science and decided to stop writing and try to make and sell WordPress plugins for a living.</p>\n<p>I discovered my tutorial on <a href=\"https://designmodo.com/wordpress-custom-login/\">building custom login</a> form on Designmodo was popular with lots of comment so I decided to make a plugin out of it. That was how my first premium plugin <a href=\"https://profilepress.net/\">ProfilePress</a> was born. I wanted to sell it on Codecanyon but it was rejected so I decided to sell it myself. It was and still hard doing development and marketing at the same time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Thankfully, after a year, it started making enough revenue for me to live pretty comfortably here in Nigeria because the cost of living here is little.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Few years later, I came across a payment processing library for PHP called <a href=\"https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay\">Omnipay</a> which included support for many payment providers like Stripe, PayPal. I use 2Checkout as my payment gateway to sell my plugins via EDD and discovered the driver for 2Checkout in Omnipay was old and unsupported so <a href=\"https://github.com/collizo4sky/omnipay-2checkout\">I built one</a>. I figured I could make money building EDD and WooCommerce payment gateways base on the Omnipay and I did and place them on Codecanyon for sale. They didn’t do well sales wise and I had to stop selling them and moved the 2Checkout gateway for WooCommerce to <a href=\"https://omnipay.io/\">omnipay.io</a>. I have since built an EDD Paddle gateway which I now sell alongside.</p>\n<p>My latest product is <a href=\"https://mailoptin.io/\">MailOptin</a>, a WordPress optin form and automated newsletter plugin. I initially built it for my own need. I figured there might be interest in it so I made a free version and a paid version.</p>\n<p>I currently live on the revenue from my plugins.</p>\n<h3>Wrap Up</h3>\n<p>I am thankful for WordPress because without it, I&#8217;m really not sure I would have been able to live a decent life. Who knows what would have become of me.</p>\n<p>I am also thankful for the community. I have made lots of friends that has been very supportive and helpful in my journey.</p>\n<p>If you live in a third world country like myself and going through hardship, I hope my story will inspire you to be great.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I tell people, life won’t give you what you want. You demand from life what you want. You make these demands by being determined and never giving up on your dreams and aspiration.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you are poor perhaps because you came from a humble and poor background, it is not your fault. You can’t go back in time to change things. I implore you to be strong, determined and hustle hard.</p>\n<p>I will end with this story.</p>\n<p>Two guys had become shipwrecked and were directionless-ly drifting on the vast ocean, desperately holding onto a wooden plank.</p>\n<p>A big ship comes along.

Read on to find out what happened in the WordPress project last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress Leadership Grows</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a milestone announcement this month, WordPress project lead, Matt Mullenweg (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matt/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>matt</a>), <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2019/01/16/expanding-wordpress-leadership/\">named two individuals</a> who are coming on board to expand the leadership team of the project.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Executive Director, Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>chanthaboune</a>) will oversee <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">all the contribution teams</a> across the project. As Marketing &amp; Communications Lead, Joost de Valk (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/joostdevalk/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>joostdevalk</a>) will lead <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/\">the Marketing team</a> and generally oversee improvements to WordPress.org.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Josepha and Joost have contributed to the WordPress project for many years and will certainly have a much larger impact going forward in their new roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress 5.1 Development Continues</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Immediately after the 5.0 release of WordPress, work started on version 5.1 with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/5-1/\">some highly anticipated new features</a> coming out in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/wordpress-5-1-beta-1/\">the first beta release</a>. Since then, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/wordpress-5-1-beta-2/\">second</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/wordpress-5-1-beta-3/\">third</a> betas have been made available.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the core updates in this release — <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/14/php-site-health-mechanisms-in-5-1/\">a feature to improve the way in which WordPress handles PHP errors</a> — has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/30/wordpress-5-1-beta-3-delay/\">been pushed back</a> to version 5.2 due to unforeseen issues that would have caused significant delays to the 5.1 release.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in testing or building WordPress Core? You can install <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">the WordPress Beta Tester plugin</a>, follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>, and join the #core channel in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The WordPress Coding Standards team <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards/releases/tag/2.0.0\">released version 2.0</a> this month.</li><li>In her new role as Executive Director, Josepha Haden <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2019/01/21/our-strengths-and-challenges/\">looks at what contributors need</a> to help support them more effectively.</li><li>Approximately 2,300 tickets in the Core bug tracker <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/14/follow-up-on-recent-trac-bulk-edit/\">were closed</a> in a large bulk edit this month due to their inactivity over the last two years.</li><li>Autocomplete for usernames has been added to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forums/\">the WordPress Support Forums</a>, making it much easier to communicate directly with individuals.</li><li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/gutenberg/\">Work continues on the Gutenberg project</a>, expanding into more areas of the WordPress dashboard.</li><li>Since the new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">WordPress Support portal</a> release in December, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2019/01/28/summary-for-docs-team-meeting-28-january-2019/\">work has been ongoing</a> to improve its features and complete the content migration.</li><li>The Plugin Review team has published <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2019/01/28/reminder-about-behavior/\">an important reminder about behavior</a> in the Plugin Directory and support forums.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Have a story that we should include in the next “Month in WordPress” post?

Consider setting up a test site to play with the new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to test the WordPress 5.1 beta: try the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a>plugin (you’ll want to select the “bleeding edge nightlies” option), or you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.1-beta3.zip\">download the beta here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1 is slated for release on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-1/\">February 21</a>, and we need your help to get there!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Site Health Check</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the features originally slated for WordPress 5.1—the PHP error protection handler—will target WordPress 5.2 instead. Some potential security issues were discovered in the implementation: rather than risk releasing insecure code, the team decided to pull it out of WordPress 5.1. The work in <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46130\">#46130</a> is showing good progress towards addressing the security concerns, if you&#8217;d like to follow development progress on this feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Additional Changes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A handful of smaller bugs have also been fixed in this release, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>TinyMCE has been upgraded to version 4.9.2 (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46094\">#46094</a>).</li><li>The block editor has had a couple of bugs fixed (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46137\">#46137</a>).</li><li>A few differences in behaviour between the classic block and the classic editor have been fixed (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46062\">#46062</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46071\">#46071</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46085\">#46085</a>).</li><li>When adding <code>rel</code> attributes to links, ensure the value isn&#8217;t empty (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/45352\">#45352</a>), and that it works as expected with customizer changesets (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/45292\">#45292</a>).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Developer Notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1 has many changes aimed at polishing the developer experience. To keep you informed, we publish&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/5-1+dev-notes/\">developers&#8217; notes</a>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> throughout the release cycle.

Respondens&#8217; unique design reflects an ethic where subscribers are treated as a community of people who want to be involved in the production of the news they read. In the future, Ernst hopes to market Respondens to support its development and spread the practice of what we might call &#8220;responsive journalism.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ernst and his colleagues intend to avoid the churn of breaking news by taking a structural focus on the issues they cover, working in the tradition of constructive, problem-solving, or &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solutions_journalism\">solutions journalism</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">9/ Not just the problem, but what can be done about it.

The constructiveness of this approach may have a lot to do with its calming and humanizing effects.</p>\n<p>Ernst has written several Dutch best-sellers, including a <a href=\"https://dankboek.nl/\"><em>Thank-You Book</em></a> or &#8220;gratitude&#8221; journal that came out of his efforts to overcome anxiety about public speaking. In his reflections on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9vLHFza8Uc&t=4s\">work, overwork, and gratitude</a> for TEDx, Ernst emphasizes that resistance to &#8220;the burnout society&#8221; where &#8220;creativity is crushed&#8221; is a collective task: everyone needs to make daily space for their close relationships where work and media do not intrude.</p>\n<p>I am grateful Ernst took some time after the holidays to talk about his experience with WordPress, collaborative online communities, and democratized journalism. Here is the conversation we had.</p>\n<p><b>DK: What are your thoughts about WordPress today? Have you made any connections or maintained relationships with the WP community in other ways?</b></p>\n<p><strong>EP:</strong> I started using WordPress in 2006 when I launched my personal blog ahead of an internship at a press agency in the United Nations HQ in New York. The fact that I then, as a twenty-year-old, could start a publication in such an easy way, has been crucial in my career and something I will be the WordPress community eternally grateful for. Since then, I have started several sites, most of them running on WordPress. In 2007 I co-founded the blog of The Next Web Conference, now known as <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/\">thenextweb.com</a>, in 2009 I started a news blog for the Dutch daily <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRC_Next\">nrc.next</a>, and in 2010, as head of digital at the Dutch quality newspaper (NRC Handelsblad), I switched their main site from &#8216;Escenic&#8217; to WordPress. The fact that we could so easily build our own plugins (for example, a liveblog feature to cover the Arab spring) was crucial in the success of that news site. Also, the developers enjoyed their work more, since they could give back to the community.</p>\n<p>I still run my personal site on WordPress, and even though I don&#8217;t publish there anymore, I love to stay in the loop of new WordPress releases and the ever-increasing user-friendliness of the software. In lost moments, I enjoy reading the developers forums and checking their discussions about new releases (I admire the distributed, self-organizing and voluntary efforts of the community) but I&#8217;m not in touch with one of the members. I&#8217;m just an admiring bystander.</p>\n<p><strong>DK: Can you explain when and why you came to see community and membership features as essential to a CMS? What does it look like when the idea of membership/audience inclusion is integral to the software architecture and vision? How are you doing this in Respondens?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>EP:</strong> The main consideration was <em>focus</em>. We wanted a CMS that only had features for our writers that we deemed important. We didn&#8217;t want to create any distraction by having other options available — both to our developers as to our writers. If we build it ourselves, we force ourselves to make conscious decisions about every new feature we add. I.e., we wouldn&#8217;t just switch a &#8216;like&#8217; button on in the comment section, simply because it&#8217;s already there. Forcing ourselves to do this made sure we built a laser-focused CMS and publication. The focus and the calm that follows makes it unique. (See &#8220;<a href=\"https://thecorrespondent.com/4108/cultivating-calm-a-design-philosophy-for-the-digital-age/242162492-d0fffdf8\">Cultivating calm: a design philosophy for the digital age</a>.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>Also, our approach to reader interaction — as you mentioned — is a unique asset of our CMS. I elaborate on that in this Medium post, &#8220;<a href=\"https://medium.com/de-correspondent/reinventing-the-rolodex-why-were-asking-our-60-000-members-what-they-know-9be6a857c340\">Reinventing the Rolodex: Why we’re asking our 60,000 members what they know</a>.&#8221; We believe in the democratization of the journalistic research process. Anyone could be a source, anyone has expertise and knowledge to share within a specific niche.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1/ THREAD: There’s a great untapped resource in journalism, and it’s available to every journalist right now.</p>\n<p>It’s the experience and expertise of your *readers*.</p>\n<p>Giving them the opportunity to share what they know, could fundamentally transform journalism.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Ernst Pfauth (@ejpfauth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ejpfauth/status/1072573253686882304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 11, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>DK: How does your model of membership-based journalism change at scale, when you have potentially the largest possible national and international audience? Will you still ask your journalists to spend <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-idea/q-a-ernst-jan-pfauth-ceo-co-founder-de-correspondent-e8f67755571a\">30-50% of their time</a> reading and responding to member comments and other feedback? Is this essential (or even possible) to sustain at scale?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>EP:</strong> The thought that you see your readers as sources of knowledge and expertise is crucial. It works for the local examples you mentioned, but it can also work for global topics. For example, we interviewed Shell employees from all over the world — who we found through our Dutch members forwarding a call-out. (&#8220;<a href=\"https://medium.com/de-correspondent/reader-engagement-shell-4bb6d0b8fb84\">How reader engagement helped unearth the Shell tape</a>.&#8221;) We also created the position of &#8220;conversation editor&#8221; to help journalists with the scalability of their reader interaction.</p>\n<p>Yes, there are scale challenges. We see our journalists as conversation leaders and our members as contributing experts. We notice when a journalist gets more feedback from their sources (their readers), they need a research assistant to keep up — for example by highlighting interesting contributions to them or taking over some interviews. These are tasks that can be easily outsourced, as long as the correspondent remains the main point of contact in the comment sections and guides the conversation.</p>\n<p>I don’t see the 30 and 50 percent as time to spend on ‘responding to comments.’ The comments are just a means to an end. The end goal is to involve your audience, so you can get a wider set of sources, become more inclusive and publish richer journalism. We estimate it takes 30 to 50 percent of your time to live up to that mission.</p>\n<p><strong>DK: On the other end of the spectrum, does your model have things to teach small, local journalism and other membership-focused businesses that they don&#8217;t already know? In the new membership-based local journalism I&#8217;ve been watching in the US and Canada — local media startups where there&#8217;s no history or expectation of a printed product or advertising — there&#8217;s a definite limit on the subjects that can be curated and written (or spoken) about in a deep and penetrating way. Is this a low or slow-growth model that simply must be accepted?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>EP:</strong> It starts with being open about your mission as a journalist (all our new correspondents publish a mission statement when they start working with us) and then telling your audience what you expect from them. It’s about that personal relationship. The CMS, practices, technology and resources all follow. But it’s the being open to your audience input and being open about your shared goal with them that’s crucial. Anyone can do that. And when you start, it might even be easier to do it on a small scale, but it’s more intimate, and you can scale up as you get better at it.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_53976\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-53976 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/295952-tc_team_behindthescenes_07-521ac4-original-1542160485.jpg\" alt=\"The Correspondent team\" width=\"4000\" height=\"2667\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Correspondent team browses their unbreaking newspaper.

Are you still a practitioner of journaling and daily gratitude? Have your thoughts on that changed or deepened? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>EP:</strong> I still write in a gratitude journal every night and noticed this three-year habit has really made me more aware of ordinary but beautiful moments in life, and also taught me to enjoy the process instead of the end goal. I save my evenings and (80% of) my weekends for family and friends — and always have my phone on DND in those hours. Also: I don&#8217;t check my email before I have left my apartment.

One of those was the need for various teams across the project to work together better. The friction during the 5.0 development cycle was beneficial in that it surfaced areas where the project can grow and sparked conversations that are already leading to improvements. </p>\n<p>Last week Mullenweg announced that WordPress is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2019/01/16/expanding-wordpress-leadership/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">expanding its leadership team</a> to include Josepha Haden in a new Executive Director role and Joost de Valk as the Marketing and Communications Lead. These new roles better distribute project leadership to more individuals who have demonstrated the ability and judiciousness to guide large, diverse teams towards success. Haden will be overseeing WordPress&#8217; contributor teams and de Valk is leading the marketing team and overseeing improvements to WordPress&#8217; websites and other outlets. </p>\n<p>The Executive Director role is particularly critical for the health of the project, as contributor and community feedback pours in across so many different mediums. Tracking all of this information and taking it into consideration amounts to a full-time job. In her first week in the new role, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2019/01/21/our-strengths-and-challenges/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Haden is seeking feedback regarding the challenges contributors face</a> when working on the project. She identified seven challenges which seem to resonate with many who have commented:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coordinating on collaborative work between teams</li>\n<li>Aligning our work better to project goals/values</li>\n<li>Understanding team roles, leadership structures, and decision making</li>\n<li>Clarifying the differences between open source and open commit</li>\n<li>Tracking conversations and progress across the project</li>\n<li>Raising project-wide concerns more easily</li>\n<li>Improving how we recognize and celebrate success</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Responses from contributors have so far revolved around a similar theme &#8211; the desire for more clearly-defined projects and goals for teams, along with more communication from leadership. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Define goals and deliverables for each project deliverable,&#8221; Daniel Bachhuber suggested. &#8220;Once these are defined, it’s much easier to estimate the level of effort and resources required. Distinguish between full-time sponsored, part-time sponsored, and completely volunteer labor. Each of these three do not work at the same pace. It’ll be much easier to estimate a team’s velocity if you know what type of labor you have to work with.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meagen Voss offered some valuable insight from a newer contributor&#8217;s perspective. She said the leadership of the project is very unclear and that people could benefit from that information being more prominently published. She also <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2019/01/21/our-strengths-and-challenges/#comment-4363\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">suggested</a> that WordPress explore the idea of having ambassadors for each team to facilitate communication and collaboration across projects.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You get to know your team very well, but no so much other teams. I’ve met some great folks in Slack and am getting to know the two groups I’m involved in super well. But if I have an issue or a question that needs to be addressed to another group, then I would have to hang out in that team’s channel for a while to figure out who the right person is to get in touch with. Identifying “ambassadors” or points of contact for each group could be a quick and helpful way to address that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The conversation is still open for contributors to jump in and share their own challenges and suggestions. Haden plans to follow up with the next steps after gathering more feedback. Action born out of these conversations has the potential to greatly improve contributors&#8217; experiences working together, resulting in fewer people burning out on communication struggles or losing momentum from lack of clearly defined objectives.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 22:23:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"Matt: Thich Nhat Hanh on Tea\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48949\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://ma.tt/2019/01/thich-nhat-hanh-on-tea/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:331:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the world earth revolves &#8211; slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future.</p><cite>— Thich Nhat Hanh in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009U9S6VM/\">The Miracle of Mindfulness</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 21:27:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce Launches New Mobile Apps for iOS and Android\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86988\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-launches-new-mobile-apps-for-ios-and-android\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3641:\"<p>This week marks the first <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/try-the-new-woocommerce-mobile-app-for-key-metrics-order-look-up-and-notifications-cha-ching/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">public release</a> of WooCommerce&#8217;s new mobile app for <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.woocommerce.android\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a> and the improved version for <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1389130815\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">iOS</a>. WooCommerce began beta testing the Android app late last year and the original iOS app has been updated to offer the same features.</p>\n<p>This first release should be considered a basic start that is mostly useful for tracking store performance with detailed stats and getting alerts for new orders and product reviews. Users cannot add or edit products and the app does not yet allow for switching between stores. The first release offers basic order management and fulfillment but does not include the ability to change order status. The mobile apps don&#8217;t yet live up to their tagline of &#8220;Your store in your pocket,&#8221; but it&#8217;s a good starting place. </p>\n<p>According to the Google Play Store, the WooCommerce app has been installed more than 10,000 times and the response from users has been mixed. The app is averaging a 2.5-star rating after early reviews from 45 users. The iOS app has received similar responses. Many of the negative reviews are due to connection/login issues and the requirement for stores to use Jetpack.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This has promise, but get rid of the need for Jetpack,&#8221; one reviewer wrote. &#8220;There are other secure ways of syncing up. Other apps have done it for years. This app has been long overdue, but is poor in execution when you need to install a plugin that tends to bog down your site and that most don&#8217;t need. Give an alternative means of syncing and allow us to edit at least the basics of a product on the go.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WooCommerce marketing representative Marina Pape explained the Jetpack requirement in a post announcing the mobile apps&#8217; launch:  </p>\n<blockquote><p>The Jetpack plugin connects your self-hosted site to a WordPress.com account and provides a common authentication interface across lots of server configurations and architectures.</p>\n<p>Both Apple and Google only allow a single trusted sender for pushes for security reasons (read more), making Jetpack the best way for us to give you modern mobile app features like push notifications.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In order to connect sites with the app, Jetpack creates a shadow site on WordPress.com&#8217;s servers and syncs quite a bit of data. Although this <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/what-data-does-jetpack-sync/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">list of data</a> is transparently outlined, the Jetpack requirement is a deal breaker for some users. They either object to sharing their data or believe the plugin will slow down their stores. Until the app&#8217;s features are more compelling than the detriments users perceive in Jetpack, it may lose a few users based on this requirement.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/shop\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BuiltWith</a>, WooCommerce is now the most popular shopping cart technology used by 22% of the top 1 million websites, with competitors Shopify and Magento not too far behind at 17% and 13% respectively. Having a new mobile app should help WooCommerce remain competitive, but the team needs to keep iterating on the app to make it more useful for those managing stores on the go.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 05:35:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg Phase 2 to Update Core Widgets to Blocks, Classic Widget in Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86953\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-phase-2-to-update-core-widgets-to-blocks-classic-widget-in-development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5791:\"<p>Gutenberg phase 2 development is underway and one of the first orders of business is porting all existing core widgets to blocks.

Mark Uraine, a designer who works at Automattic, created some mockups to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/13204\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">kick off the discussion</a> about what this screen might look like. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cW5MOA5gsTG\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/cldup.com/o9-F6ebs7m.gif?resize=627%2C421&ssl=1\" alt=\"Widgets as blocks\" width=\"627\" height=\"421\" /></a></p>\n<p>These mockups are just explorations of where widgets may be headed next, and they do not take into account everything that will be required of this screen. </p>\n<p>Nick Halsey, one of the maintainers for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/components/customize/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress&#8217; Customize component</a> recommended abandoning this screen altogether in favor of showing widget block areas in the Customizer:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The widgets admin screen has a fundamental disconnect with the way that widget areas actually work &#8211; with different areas showing in different parts of the screen and potentially on different parts of the site. It will be very difficult to clearly reflect the frontend page structure on this screen in a way that users will be able to understand. Experimenting with contextual approaches to this experience in the customizer offers numerous opportunities for this fundamental problem to be solved. Starting with the visible edit shortcuts that are already in core, revamped widgets could be edited directly on the frontend (of the customize preview) or in an overlay that is more directly related to the display on a particular screen. The ability to navigate to different parts of the site within the customize preview solves a problem that this screen will never be able to address.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Getting blocks to work in the Customizer is also part of phase 2, but conversation on the ticket related to wp-admin/widgets.php indicates the team is not going to abandon this screen just yet. </p>\n<p>&#8220;While this screen will eventually be deprecated in the future, especially as more of the site is built in Gutenberg, it&#8217;s a necessary &#8220;baby step&#8221; to get us all there together,&#8221; Uraine said. &#8220;Maybe the best thing is to keep the existing layout, but just allow the use of all blocks within the accordion content areas? This will keep our resources and investment minimal on this particular piece with just a few suggested tweaks to the mockup in the initial post. It will also allow us to move to the Customizer more quickly.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Gutenberg accessibility contributor Andrea Fercia encouraged contributors to address accessibility before creating visual mockups by designing the information architecture first. He encouraged them to organize the required information and controls while thinking about how someone might navigate them in a linear way. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The customizer is not fully accessible,&#8221; Fercia said. &#8220;The admin widgets screen is the only place where persons with accessibility needs have a chance to manage widgets without having to face big accessibility barriers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Discussion on the future of the widget management screen continues in the ticket and contributors are looking to get more input during this exploration stage. There&#8217;s also a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/projects/22\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">project board</a> where anyone can share a blog post with their own explorations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/projects/20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Porting widgets to blocks</a> has its own project board if you want to follow along or jump in on an issue. Most of the core blocks are already finished and a handful are still in progress. </p>\n<p>Updating the widgets management page and bringing blocks into the Customizer is a major overhaul but will further unify WordPress&#8217; interface for editing and previewing content. Widgets have served WordPress well over the years, making it easy for users to customize their websites without having to know how to code. The feature has also <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-future-of-wordpress-widgets-a-better-ui-with-real-time-previews\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">survived many evolutions</a>, eventually <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/widget-customizer-approved-for-wordpress-3-9\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">making its way into the Customizer five years ago in WordPress 3.9</a>. One of the limitations with widgets is that they can only be used in &#8220;widgetized&#8221; areas. Transforming widgets into blocks removes that limitation and makes it possible to use widgets in posts and pages as well.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 21:11:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 5.1 Beta 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6550\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/wordpress-5-1-beta-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4498:\"<p>WordPress 5.1 Beta 2 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

WPML founder Amir Helzer suspects that the attacker is a former employee. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The customer is an ex-employee who left an exploit on the server (not WPML plugin) before leaving. Besides fixing the damage, we’ll also be taking legal actions,&#8221; Helzer said Saturday night.</p>\n<p>The WPML team worked around the clock over the weekend to secure their systems and sent out an email informing customers of the incident. They also assured customers that the WPML plugin does not contain an exploit and that payment information was not compromised. The company published an <a href=\"https://wpml.org/2019/01/wpml-org-site-back-to-normal-after-an-attack-during-the-weekend/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> to their website, detailing the incident and their response: </p>\n<blockquote><p>We updated wpml.org, rebuilt everything and reinstalled everything. We secured access to the admin use 2-factor authentication and minimized the access that the web server has to the file system.</p>\n<p>These are more precautions than actual response to the hack. Our data shows that the hacker used inside information (an old SSH password) and a hole that he left for himself while he was our employee.</p>\n<p>This hack was not done via an exploit in WordPress, WPML or another plugin, but using this inside information. In any case, the damage is great and it’s done already.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WPML urges customers not to click on any links in the email the attacker sent out and recommends they change their passwords for wpml.org. The attacker has customer names, emails, and sitekeys, but WPML said the sitekeys cannot be used to push changes to customer websites.</p>\n<p>Helzer is convinced that the attack was an inside job and suspects two former employees. He and his team are working to provide evidence to the authorities. He said the the nature of the attack demonstrates that it was likely not an outside hacker:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>The first time our site was breached was on the day we fired an employee, who had access to our servers. We didn&#8217;t identify the breach at that time. However, once we got hacked, we analyzed the original hole and we found in our log when it was placed (yup, he deleted the log, but he didn&#8217;t delete the backup). Now that we finished cleaning up the mess, we&#8217;re going through all logs and collecting the full evidence.</li>\n<li>The attacker targeted specific code and database tables that are unique to our site and not generic WordPress or WPML tables.</li>\n<li>The attacker crafted the attack so that it would cause us long term damage and not be apparent in first sight. That long-term damage is very difficult to guess without knowing our business objectives and challenges. This is information that our employees have, but we don&#8217;t disclose.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea that a former employee who is known to the company would risk performing these illegal actions is difficult to grasp, even in the case of someone who was fired and may have been acting in retaliation. The risks of being caught seem too great.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In many jurisdictions including the USA, this is jail time,&#8221; Wordfence CEO Mark Maunder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmaunder/status/1086839572384940033\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;So I find it quite incredible that an employee would leave a backdoor, use it to deface their site, steal their data and email all subscribers. This is the infosec equivalent of walking into a police precinct and tagging the wall while the cops watch.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Helzer said the incident should serve as a wakeup call for companies that employ remote workers. It highlights the importance of having procedures in place for revoking employee access to all systems used as part of day to day operations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have to admit that our site was not secured well enough,&#8221; Helzer said. &#8220;If someone previously had admin access and stopped working for us, we should have been more careful and avoided this situation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This can be a wakeup call for others. We talk a lot about the benefits or remote work and most of the WordPress industry works remotely. This made us realize that we need to be a lot more pessimistic when we allow any access to our system.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For example, the fact that we’re now coding for ourselves a requirement to login with 2fa, means that we’re not alone in this exposed situation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The attacker&#8217;s unauthorized email and WPML&#8217;s response email went out over the weekend, so many customers will be learning of the incident today when they return to work. Helzer said customers have been supportive so far.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that customers appreciate the fact that we contacted them as fast as we could and we dropped everything and ran to handle this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think that we&#8217;ll still have damage. Clients did not run away from us right now but a good reputation is something that you build over years. A nasty incident like this stays &#8216;on your record.&#8217; This is our livelihood and we take it seriously.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 16:21:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WPTavern: WPML Website Hacked, Customer Emails Compromised\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86908\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wptavern.com/wpml-website-hacked-customer-emails-compromised\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3452:\"<p>On Saturday, January 19, WPML customers started reporting having received an email from someone who seems to have hacked the plugin&#8217;s website and gained access to customer information.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Got same mail and there is this text on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wpml?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#wpml</a> website visible now.

The <a href=\"https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google News Initiative</a> has contributed $1.2 million towards the development of &#8220;<a href=\"http://newspack.blog/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Newspack</a>&#8221; on top of WordPress.com&#8217;s infrastructure. </p>\n<p>Automattic and Google have joined with other contributing partners from the broader world of journalism for a total of $2.4 million in funding for the first year of the project. These partners include <a href=\"https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Lenfest Institute for Journalism</a> ($400K), ConsenSys, the venture studio behind <a href=\"https://civil.co/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Civil Media</a> ($350K), The <a href=\"http://kf.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">John S. and James L. Knight Foundation</a> ($250K), and an additional partner who will join later this month. <a href=\"https://spiritedmedia.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spirited Media</a> and <a href=\"https://fundjournalism.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">News Revenue Hub</a> will also contribute to the creation of the platform.</p>\n<p>Local news organizations are critical for a healthy democratic society, keeping the public informed about things happening close to home. The move to digital news consumption has forced consolidation in the news industry where larger players have come out ahead while smaller publications struggle to stay above water. </p>\n<p>In a report called &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Expanding News Desert</a>,&#8221; published in 2018, researchers at the University of North Carolina found that nearly one in five newspapers has disappeared during the past 15 years. Many others have become &#8220;ghost newspapers,&#8221; shells of what they once were &#8211; either absorbed by larger dailies that purchased them or suffering from a severely pared back newsroom that is unable to adequately cover local events.</p>\n<p>WordPress.com has amassed an expert team to address this crisis in local news. The Newspack platform will cater to the technological and editorial needs of smaller newsrooms, with the monetization tools to make their work sustainable. WordPress.com is currently accepting <a href=\"https://newspack.blog/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">applications for charter participants</a> and plans to launch in beta near the end of July 2019.</p>\n<h3>Open Source Newspack Platform to Offer an Alternative to Expensive Proprietary CMS&#8217;s</h3>\n<p>The WordPress community has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carlhancock/status/1084900673559371776\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">speculated</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/1084887261471072257\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">widely</a> about what shape Newspack will take, whether it will be like WordPress.com VIP tailored to publications or something similar to Jetpack with a curated set of tools that could be used by self-hosted sites through SaaS upgrades. According to WordPress.com president Kinsey Wilson, a former executive for NPR and The New York Times who joined Automattic in 2018, the platform may end up being a hybrid of approaches. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s still very early in the process, but I expect elements of both VIP and Jetpack to inform this,&#8221; Kinsey said. &#8220;Newspack will be part of the WordPress.com platform, but we’re going to be working on a highly curated experience tailored to these news organizations, with individualized support available across editorial and business.&#8221; </p>\n<p>The platform will support plugins that solve problems publishers experience at the local level and will also include Gutenberg-specific editorial tools.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It will leverage Gutenberg,&#8221; Kinsey said. &#8220;A few examples of the tools that might be launched with Newspack include email integration for marketing and editorial; programmatic ad integration, analytics, real-time backups, and revenue generating tools for subscriptions and e-commerce. We hope to work closely with partners across the WordPress ecosystem for potential ways to work with services that are beneficial to news organizations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The most important distinction of the Newspack platform is that it will be open source. That also puts it directly in competition with proprietary CMS&#8217;s like Arc, Vox Media&#8217;s Chorus CMS, and MediaOS, that are prominent in the news industry right now. Instead of working together, larger media companies have opted to build their own CMS&#8217;s and many of them are also <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/11/is-it-finally-time-for-media-companies-to-adopt-a-common-publishing-platform/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">licensing enterprise versions to publishers or offering them as SaaS solutions</a>.</p>\n<p>I asked Kinsey if Newspack will be something news organizations could self-host or if it will be inextricably tied to WordPress.com&#8217;s infrastructure. WordPress.com is making it open in the sense that publishers will not be tied to using it forever if they want to their information and copy the same setup somewhere else.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is not only open source, it will be designed so that at any point in time any individual site or even a commercial competitor could capture an image of the setup and port it to another platform,&#8221; Kinsey said. &#8220;The value we offer is our knowledge of the news industry, our ability to keep pace with new requirements, and our ability to vet various plug-ins and open-source contributions to the project for security and interoperability &#8212; all at an attractive operating cost of between $1,000 and $2,000 per month. In addition, we hope to expose news organizations to a wider community of like-minded developers and to create an on-boarding system that simplifies the setup.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Operating costs on proprietary platforms are much higher than what WordPress.com is planning for Newspack. Arc costs smaller publishers <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/washington-post-building-tech-platform-arc/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$10,000 per month in software licensing fees</a> and can cost up to $150,000 monthly for larger publications. Vox media executives <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/vox-media-to-begin-licensing-publishing-technology-chorus-1531828800\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told the Wall Street Journal</a> that the company &#8220;plans to sell Chorus at different pricing tiers depending on the demands of each customer with fees in the six and seven-figure ranges.&#8221; Small local news publications are often priced out of using a publishing platform like this.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It breaks my heart how much of their limited resources these organizations still sink into closed-source or dead-end technology,&#8221; Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg said in a <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2019/01/journalism-and-newspack/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> introducing Newspack on his blog. &#8220;Open source is clearly the future, and if we do this right Newspack can be the technology choice that lasts with them through the decades, and hopefully our 15 years of growth lends some credibility to our orientation to build things for the long term.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s support of Newspack is in line with its history of building with and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/google-launches-opensource-dev-as-an-introduction-to-open-source\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">supporting open source projects</a>. When asked for clarification on Google&#8217;s investment in the project, Kinsey said, &#8220;It is a donation that is intended to support work that otherwise would not likely find commercial support because of the relatively modest means of small digital publishers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress.com&#8217;s Newspack announcement comes on the heels of the news of <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2019/01/16/when-digital-first-media-gannetts-hostile-suitor-comes-town/2579392002/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Digital First Media&#8217;s unsolicited $1.36 billion bid for Gannett</a>. The future of local news is tenuous, as larger players in the industry press for more consolidation and cost-cutting journalism. In the same week, Facebook, who has had a hot and cold relationship with publishers, announced the company is investing <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/blog/doing-more-to-support-local-news\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$300 million to support local news</a>.</p>\n<p>In recognition of the dire situation facing many local newsrooms, the largest companies on the web are committing funds to help them find a sustainable business model. WordPress.com&#8217;s Newspack platform, with its affordable, open source alternative to proprietary systems, is positioned to make a strong impact during this seminal time in the evolution of the news industry. </p>\n<p>&#8220;By itself, an open source CMS is not going to help news organizations remain independent,&#8221; Kinsey said. &#8220;However, by helping new, emerging organizations overcome the complexity and cost typically associated with technology deployment and instead allowing them to focus resources on journalism and smart business practices, we think we can help them become more sustainable.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 22:52:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"Matt: My TED Video on the Future of Work\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48932\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://ma.tt/2019/01/ted-the-future-of-work/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2707:\"<p>I was thrilled to participate in TED’s new video series, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TEDsTheWayWeWork/videos/294277961234005/\">The Way We Work</a>, and not surprisingly I made the case that distributed work is <a href=\"https://qz.com/694410/automattic-has-figured-out-the-right-tools-for-remote-working/\">where everything is headed</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div id=\"fb-root\"></div>&version;<div class=\"fb-video\"><blockquote cite=\"https://www.facebook.com/TEDsTheWayWeWork/videos/294277961234005/\" class=\"fb-xfbml-parse-ignore\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TEDsTheWayWeWork/videos/294277961234005/\">Why Working from Home Is Better for Business</a><p>This company is so dedicated to remote working that they literally don&#039;t have an office.

What I really love about this video in particular is that we get into the specifics of <em>how</em> a company can start to embrace a culture of letting employees work from anywhere, even if it started out as a traditional office with everyone in the same place. Automattic never started that way, so even as we’ve scaled up to more than <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/\">840 people</a> in 68 countries, there’s never been a question — it’s now built in to our entire culture.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For distributed work to scale up, it’s going to require more CEOs, workers, and managers to test the waters. Any company can experiment with distributed work — just pick a day or two of the week in which everyone works from home, I suggest Tuesdays and Thursdays, then build the tools and systems to support it. Yes, that may require some shuffling of meetings, or more written documentation versus verbal real-time discussion. But I think companies will be surprised how quickly it will “just work.” <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the companies don’t experiment, workers may force them to do it anyway: <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I don\'t think tech folks quite understand how pervasive remote work has become.

Previously, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/\">plugin</a> allowed users to display a grid of products by category. The new version introduces a Featured Product Block with design options for customizing nearly everything about the display, including color overlay, price and description, text alignment, call-to-action button, and the product photo. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Version 1.3.0 also introduces a Hand-Picked Products block that displays a grid of manual selections that can be ordered in different ways. Other new blocks include the following, which display as a grid and can be filtered by category:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Best Selling Products block</li><li>Top Rated Products block</li><li>Newest Products block</li><li>On Sale Products block</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce Blocks is also now a <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/what-is-a-woocommerce-feature-plugin/\">feature plugin</a>, which means that after it is more polished and tested, the plugin can be considered for merge into WooCommerce core. WooCommerce Blocks 1.4 is expected the last week in January with improvements to the Featured Product block and a new Products by Attribute block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In December 2018, WooCommerce <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/people-behind-stores/\">published usage data</a> that indicates 40% of users who could be considered &#8220;established business owners&#8221; also have a brick-and-mortar location, and 27% host events in physical locations. This means that many WooCommerce store owners have multiple channels for selling their products. The data also showed that large stores don&#8217;t always turn to big companies to handle their website development needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on that usage data, blocks have the potential to greatly improve the site management experience for many WooCommerce store owners who want to market to different audiences beyond their physical stores. Blocks enable them to easily swap out featured products and customize promotions on products that are selling well in their stores. All of these actions are quick to configure inside the new editor with a live preview. The sooner this feature plugin lands in WooCommerce core, the easier it will be to make these kinds of quick updates. Store owners with sites running on WordPress 5.0+ can take advantage of these blocks now by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/\">installing the plugin</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 20:11:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: CoBlocks Adds Row and Columns Page Building Blocks for Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86811\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/coblocks-adds-row-and-columns-page-building-blocks-for-gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3005:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/coblocks/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CoBlocks</a>, one of the earliest block collections for Gutenberg, has added new page building blocks and tools in the latest <a href=\"https://richtabor.com/coblocks-gutenberg-page-builder/\">1.6 release</a>.

Users can customize the fonts with built-in controls for line-height, letter-spacing, font-weight, and text-transform properties. It also supports customizing fonts for the core heading, paragraph, and button blocks. </p>\n<p>The video below shows a quick demo of column layouts and nested row blocks in action, as well as a few other blocks in the collection. Tabor said the team has more blocks in development that are geared towards full page layout and design. They are also working on a more advanced Google Maps block, feature blocks, and image cards.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Gutenberg team has been <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4900\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">discussing a &#8220;section&#8221; block</a> since February 2018, where columns blocks could be placed inside the more generic section container. It&#8217;s on the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/13113\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">roadmap for Phase 2</a> but contributors are taking their time to carefully define how this block will work. In the meantime, plugin developers have created their own versions of sections.</p>\n<p>CoBlocks is currently setting the bar for Gutenberg-powered layouts. When WordPress core gets deeper into site building, this plugin&#8217;s user-friendly approach to rows and columns should provide some inspiration for creating an intuitive page building experience.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 01:49:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: WordPress Support Forums Add @mentions with Auto-complete\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86721\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-support-forums-add-mentions-with-auto-complete\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1852:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forums/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Support forums</a> have been updated to include Twitter/GitHub style <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2488\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">auto-completion for usernames</a>.

More than $10,000 has come in through WPCamps&#8217; crowdfunding campaign. Shortly before WordCamp US 2018, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/interview-with-rachel-cherry-automattic-pledges-to-fund-wpcampus-accessibility-audit-of-gutenberg\">Automattic pledged to fund the remainder</a> of the audit. The final cost for the chosen vendor is $31,200.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A diverse committee of WordPress, accessibility, and higher education professionals evaluated seven proposals before selecting Tenon LLC. The company&#8217;s Tenon API delivers advanced reporting that assists clients in understanding which issues to prioritize first in the process of building more accessible experiences. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/access-monitor-plugin-tests-wordpress-sites-for-accessibility-compliance\">Access Monitor plugin</a> for WordPress is an example of a tool built using this API. Site administrators can use it to identify and tackle accessibility issues with the help of automated testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WPCampus will leave its crowdfunding campaign open until Friday, February 8 to allow more community participation. The organization plans to deliver a progress update on Thursday, January 31, and is aiming to complete the audit by late February.

I will give a special call out to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TBKYK60/\">The Paper Menagerie by Ken Liu</a>. Leaving my Kindle Oasis at an airport ended up being a blessing in disguise as I started using the Kindle app on my iPhone a lot more and that&#8217;s become my new favorite habit. (And the physical Kindle was returned!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a strong travel year, covering 126 cities, 20 countries, and 377k miles. I especially enjoyed visits to Tulum, Iceland, Bodrum, Tonga, Kauai, Lanai, and Courchevel. I finally checked off my bucket list item to become scuba certified and had an amazing opportunity to swim with humpback whales.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://ma.tt/files/2019/01/Tonga-Wanderings-2-of-5-1024x635.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48914\" />I was a few feet from <a href=\"https://www.comewander.com/\">Adam Gazzaley when he took this photo</a>.\n\n\n\n<p>I also had lots of opportunities to practice patience, weathered a torrent of personally-directed criticism across every medium, and had a few months that were the hardest I&#8217;ve worked in my career. With the benefit of a little distance, though, those things don&#8217;t loom as large. I learned a ton —&nbsp;often the hard way but often that&#8217;s what it takes —&nbsp;and discovered I had some additional gears that can kick in when needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I pass solidly into my mid-thirties, I don&#8217;t have any drastic shifts on the horizon but I am looking forward to continuing to strengthen the habits I&#8217;ve been able to develop this past year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other years: <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2003/01/bday/\">19</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2004/01/so-im-20/\">20</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2005/01/hot-barely-legal-matt/\">21</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2006/01/matt-22/\">22</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2007/01/twenty-three/\">23</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2008/01/twenty-four/\">24</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2009/01/twenty-five/\">25</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2010/01/twenty-six/\">26</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2011/01/twenty-seven/\">27</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2012/01/twenty-eight/\">28</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2013/01/twenty-nine/\">29</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2014/01/matt-3-0/\">30</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2015/01/thirty-one/\">31</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/01/thirty-two/\">32</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/01/thirty-three/\">33</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2018/01/thirty-four/\">34</a>, 35.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 12 Jan 2019 00:12:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 342 – GitHub, Commercials, and Governance\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=86783&preview=true&preview_id=86783\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-342-github-commercials-and-governance\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2012:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I discuss what&#8217;s new in WordPress 5.0.3.

The automatic background update has gone out and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">23.2% of sites are currently running on 5.0+,</a> with 47.2% hanging back at 4.9. Meanwhile, work on WordPress 5.1 charges forward and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/wordpress-5-1-beta-1/\">Beta 1</a> is now available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/\">projects Matt Mullenweg identified for 2019</a> was to merge the Site Health Check plugin into core to assist with debugging and encourage &#8220;good software hygiene.&#8221; The Site Health Check project, formerly called &#8220;ServeHappy,&#8221; began with the goal of helping users get their sites running on supported versions of PHP but has evolved to include other aspects of site maintenance and debugging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1 brings one of the most exciting aspects of the Site Health Check project into core. It introduces a new <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44458\">white screen of death (WSOD) protection feature</a> that catches fatal errors so that users can still log into the admin to attempt to resolve the issue. In the past, non-technical users would have to contact their hosting companies or FTP into their files to try to fix plugin or theme compatibility issues by turning things off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In preparation for WordPress&#8217; highly anticipated <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/updating-the-minimum-php-version/\">minimum PHP version increase</a>, 5.1 will display a warning and help users upgrade their version of PHP. The minimum will be bumped to 5.6 in April and, depending on feedback, will be bumped again to 7.0 in December 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This project benefits not just WordPress users, but also the surrounding PHP ecosystem as a whole,&#8221; Jenny Wong said in the <a href=\"https://jwong.co.uk/blog/2019/01/10/how-wordpress-is-dropping-php-end-of-life-versions/\">notes</a> she published from the Site Health Check Project review at WCUS 2018. &#8220;Our hope is that this will prompt a lot of PHP updates across the web.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to take advantage of more features from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/health-check/\">Site Health Check plugin</a>, you can install it from WordPress.org and visit the Dashboard > Health Check for a detailed overview of your site. It also has a very handy troubleshooting mode that enables a vanilla WordPress session, where all plugins are disabled, and a default theme is used, but only for your user. This works without disrupting the way the site displays to visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1 also introduces some updates for developers, including the ability to replace the cron system with a custom cron handler, set a custom location for WP_DEBUG_LOG, a new <code>wp_blogmeta</code> table, and a few other changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1 is currently slated for release on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-1/\">February 21</a>. The upcoming release is a big step on WordPress&#8217; journey to becoming even more user-friendly. The idea that users will never again be locked out of their sites due to a WSOD is a major enhancement that will greatly improve the way they interact with WordPress&#8217; plugin system. It also makes the prospect of installing new themes and plugins less daunting for non-technical users.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 21:17:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 5.1 Beta 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6540\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/wordpress-5-1-beta-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4140:\"<p>WordPress 5.1 Beta 1 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong>&nbsp;so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site to play with the new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to test the WordPress 5.1 beta: try the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin (you’ll want to select the “bleeding edge nightlies” option), or you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.1-beta1.zip\">download the beta here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1 is slated for release on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-1/\">February 21</a>, and we need your help to get there. Here are some of the big items to test so we can find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Site Health Check</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Site Health Check is an ongoing project aimed at improving the stability and performance of the entire WordPress ecosystem. The first phase of this project is included in WordPress 5.1. For the first time, WordPress will catch and pause the problem code, so you can log in to your Dashboard and see what the problem is (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44458\">#44458</a>). Before, you’d have to FTP in to your files or get in touch with your host.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, in April 2019, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/updating-the-minimum-php-version/\">WordPress&#8217; will increase its minimum supported PHP version to 5.6</a>. To help you check if you&#8217;re prepared for this change, WordPress 5.1 will show you a warning and help you upgrade your version of PHP, if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>For Developers</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The Cron system can now be more easily replaced with a custom cron handler (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32656\">#32656</a>).</li><li>When starting cron under PHP-FPM, the connection will return a response immediately, even for long running cron jobs (<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/09/cron-improvements-with-php-fpm-in-wordpress-5-1/\">dev note</a>).</li><li><code>WP_DEBUG_LOG</code> can be set to a custom log location (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18391\">#18391</a>).</li><li>Introduced the <code>wp_blogmeta</code> table (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37923\">#37923</a>).</li><li>Added <code>LIKE</code> support to <code>meta_key</code> comparisons in <code>WP_Meta_Query</code> (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42409\">#42409</a>).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=5.1&group=resolution&col=id&col=summary&col=component&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=version&order=priority\">over 360 tickets closed</a> in WordPress 5.1, with numerous small bug fixes and improvements to help smooth your WordPress experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your eyes on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for more developer notes (which are <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/5-1+dev-notes/\">assigned</a> the <code>dev-notes</code> tag) in the coming weeks detailing other changes in 5.1 that you should be aware of.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help us translate WordPress into more than 100 languages!</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>If you think you’ve found a bug</em></strong><em>, you can post to the&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\"><em>Alpha/Beta area</em></a><em>&nbsp;in the support forums.

Subscriptions, Related Posts, and Tiled Galleries are now available as blocks under Jetpack in the block inserter tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />New blocks in Jetpack: Related Posts, Subscription Form, and Tiled Galleries\n\n\n\n<p>The most exciting thing for both Related Posts and the Subscription form is that they can now be placed anywhere within post or page content with a live preview. Previously these modules were limited to wherever the theme placed them, or widgetized areas in the case of the Subscription form. Below is an example:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-subscriptions\"><div class=\"jetpack_subscription_widget\">			<form action=\"https://wptavern.com/feed\" method=\"post\" accept-charset=\"utf-8\" id=\"subscribe-blog-495\">\n				<p>Join 42,970 other subscribers</p>\n					<p id=\"subscribe-email\">\n						<label id=\"jetpack-subscribe-label\" for=\"subscribe-field-495\">\n							Email Address						</label>\n						<input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" class=\"required\" value=\"\" id=\"subscribe-field-495\" />\n					</p>\n\n					<p id=\"subscribe-submit\">\n						<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"action\" value=\"subscribe\" />\n						<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"source\" value=\"https://wptavern.com/feed\" />\n						<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"sub-type\" value=\"widget\" />\n						<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"redirect_fragment\" value=\"495\" />\n												<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" name=\"jetpack_subscriptions_widget\" />\n					</p>\n							</form>\n\n			\n		\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tiled galleries can now easily be inserted, manipulated, and previewed in the new editor with all of the same features they had before. Styles and link settings for the galleries can be found in the block sidebar, but they are somewhat limited when <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-block-gallery-plugin-offers-a-suite-of-photo-gallery-blocks-for-gutenberg\">compared to other plugins like Block Gallery</a>. Now that the Jetpack team has the basic block in place, they can easily update it with new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users will need to have their Jetpack accounts connected to WordPress.com to access any of these new blocks, but they will all work on the Free plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have been missing Jetpack shortlinks since Gutenberg was released, you will be pleased to find that Jetpack 6.9 brings them back under a new Jetpack icon at the top right of the block editor.

Layers co-founders David and Marc Perel identified Gutenberg as the main reason for the sale in their farewell <a href=\"https://www.layerswp.com/2019/01/elementor-acquires-layers-wp/\">announcement</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>With the arrival of Gutenberg we realized that a big change was required for Layers to keep pace. A massive investment of time and money was needed so we had to assess the best way forward. Having spent all of our 20&#8217;s working 18 hour days to build beautiful WordPress products we reached a point where we felt it best to partner with another company to try take Layers to the next level.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor is the leading WordPress page builder, with more than a million active installations. CMO Ben Pines said they estimate that number to be closer to 2 million, based on the daily install rate. The company has grown from 6 employees to 55 since it launched in June 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor was well-prepared for Gutenberg&#8217;s inclusion in 5.0. While other page builders are still considering how to move forward with the new editor, Elementor released its <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-builder/\" target=\"_blank\">Elementor Blocks for Gutenberg</a> plugin in October 2018, making it possible for users to insert any Elementor template into Gutenberg with one click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, Layers didn&#8217;t meet the requirements for being listed in the WordPress.org themes directory, because the team decided not to follow best practices for keeping plugin and theme functionality separate. In 2016, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/layers-ends-exclusive-arrangement-with-envato-launches-new-marketplace\">Perel said they were opting to maintain Layers as a hybrid product</a>, a theme that included plugin-like functionality, in order to keep third-party conflicts to a minimum, which he said also lessened their support burden. This prevented the product from receiving greater exposure on WordPress.org. As larger page builders began to dominate the market, Layers failed to gain the traction it needed to compete. Add Gutenberg to the mix and Layers&#8217; founders were in need of an exit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We feel that this acquisition has come just at the right moment when WordPress itself is going through a huge amount of change,&#8221; Perel said. &#8220;With the release of Gutenberg and the new built-in post editor we realized that much of Layers would need to change in order to keep pace with the new look of WordPress and feel that <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://layerswp.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5b9a020fcf797987098cc7bca&id=c493b36eaa&e=4441ba6d29\" target=\"_blank\">Elementor</a> is the best company to respond to the shifting tide of the industry.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Layers&#8217; Theme Collection Is Now Free and Fully Compatible with Elementor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor has released all 11 of <a href=\"https://www.layerswp.com/product-category/themes/\">Layers&#8217; themes</a> for free and Ben Pines said they are considering listing them on WordPress.org to make it easier for users to find them and stay updated. All of the themes have been updated to be fully compatible with both Gutenberg and Elementor. Existing Layers&#8217; customers will receive two months of support before support is handed over to the Layers user community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Updating themes for compatibility is no easy matter, and we get thousands of requests asking for a theme that is compatible with Elementor,&#8221; Pines said. Finding a theme that is fully compatible with the page builder can be challenging. Pines said users often decide to use Elementor first and then look for a theme. There&#8217;s even a Facebook group called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/126645814685793/?ref=br_rs\">Elementor + Which Theme?</a> with more than 2,400 members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Themes still pose an issue for users,&#8221; Elementor&#8217;s head of business development, Zvi Shapira, said. &#8220;We saw value in continuing the Layers project, and not leaving thousands of Layers users without a home. Layers is a well worthy project, and offering a theme that is compatible with Elementor and Gutenberg for free for our users and for all WordPress users has great value.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pines identified Layers&#8217; advanced Customizer panel as one of its chief selling points. Along with the acquisition, all of the Layers Pro features, such as resizing the logo, customizing buttons, and styling menus, are now rolled into the free version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg is forcing some consolidation among page builders, as smaller operations struggle to keep pace with the technical updates required. Gutenberg is expected to standardize a way of layout building further along in the site customization phase. Pines said his team isn&#8217;t worried about how that will impact Elementor, even if core ends up overlapping with some of the solutions they offer in the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know if there will be an impact and of what sort,&#8221; Pines said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like the blocks we developed for Gutenberg. We adapted to provide our users with the maximum flexibility.&#8221; The plugin ensures that users don&#8217;t have to choose between using Gutenberg and the page builder. Acquiring Layers&#8217; theme collection means Elementor users no longer have to look so hard to find a compatible theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our hope is that Layers themes will help less tech-savvy users manage the entire site design hassle-free,&#8221; Pines said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Jan 2019 23:29:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 5.0.3 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6530\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/wordpress-5-0-3-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4566:\"<p>WordPress 5.0.3 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.0.3 is a maintenance release that includes 37 bug fixes and 7 performance updates.

The new era of &#8220;Happy Publishing&#8221; in 2019 will bring even more progress on that roadmap, enabling users to have a more unified editing experience for other aspects of content management, including <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/\">widgets and menus</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br /><br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 08 Jan 2019 23:44:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: GitHub Announces Free, Unlimited Private Repositories\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86657\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wptavern.com/github-announces-free-unlimited-private-repositories\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3488:\"<p>GitHub users no longer have to pay to keep code private. The company is now offering <a href=\"https://blog.github.com/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unlimited private repositories to Free account users</a>, with up to three collaborators. Developers have different reasons for wanting to keep their code private &#8211; it may not be ready, they may be working on a side project, or may just be starting out in their coding journey. GitHub now makes it possible for users with free accounts to do that work in private, without having to upgrade to a Pro account for $7/month.</p>\n<p>This change brings the code hosting site more in line with competitors like GitLab.com, which allows for unlimited private projects and collaborators, and Bitbucket, a platform that has offered this for much longer. Bitbucket was actually <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4428278\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitLab&#8217;s inspiration for this model</a>. </p>\n<p>GitHub&#8217;s announcement was well-received but for many who have already moved to GitLab, this news come too late. Some are also wary of giving GitHub access to their private projects after Microsoft acquired the company for $7.5 billion last year. However, GitHub seems to be focusing its efforts less on monetizing the small fish and more on evolving the company&#8217;s Enterprise offering. It has combined its Business Cloud and Enterprise products into one unified &#8220;GitHub Enterprise&#8221; product that starts at $21/user/month.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Of course the GitHub update is so bigmega giantcorp can get you to give them more info &amp; in turn more power &amp; in turn more money, if that\'s annoying &amp;/or unsavory to you there are alternatives (that are less convenient but that\'s what this is all about anyway) no grump just fact</p>\n<p>&mdash; Jon Christopher (@jchristopher) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jchristopher/status/1082353226329001985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 7, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;At GitLab we think that repositories will become a commodity,&#8221; GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/2019/01/07/github-offering-free-private-repos-for-up-to-three-collaborators/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in reaction to GitHub&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;I think Microsoft will try to generate more revenue with people using Azure more instead of paying for repos. We&#8217;re focusing on making a single application for the entire DevOps lifecycle that can replace a lot of other tools.&#8221;  </p>\n<p>Every inch given in this space makes code sharing platforms more competitive. In terms of private repositories, GitHub has come close to offering what its smaller competitors have been giving away for free for a long time. If GitHub were to add Continuous Integration (CI) for free users to match GitLab&#8217;s free tier, for example, it might capture even more of the market. Different features sway different types of users to adopt one platform or another and eventually some of those turn into paying customers.</p>\n<p>For existing GitHub Free users, unlimited private repositories means the opportunity to keep their incomplete projects out of the public eye, instead of having people stumble on them and wonder why they don&#8217;t work as expected. It also frees up a few more dollars for Pro users who want to downgrade to Free accounts.  </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 08 Jan 2019 18:46:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"Dev Blog: The Month in WordPress: December 2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6527\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/the-month-in-wordpress-december-2018/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3528:\"<p>New features, a big event, and important announcements marked December as a milestone month for the WordPress community. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Release of WordPress 5.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 6 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/bebo/\">WordPress 5.0 was released</a>.
