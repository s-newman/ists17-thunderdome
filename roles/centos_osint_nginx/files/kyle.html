<h1>My favorite basketball team... lakers</h1>

<p>
    Let me tell you about the lakers. The lakers are the best basketball 
    team because they have that one really really tall guy that can jump
    really high. The lakers win almost every game they play because they
    are so tall. lakers are the best.

    My favorite players is number 42 on the lakers. He is my favorite players
    on the lakers because his number is the best number on the lakers.
    Number 42 on the lakers is the tallest and fastest player on the lakers
    team. 

    Also, you should check out a lakers game sometime. At a lakers game
    they like to give out prizes to people that come to lakers games. This
    is another reason why the lakers are the best.
