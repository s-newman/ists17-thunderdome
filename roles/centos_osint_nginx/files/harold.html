<h1>Let me tell you about my cat... Mariah</h1>

<p>
    My cat Mariah is the best cat ever. Mariah sleeps on my face every night.
    Mariah loves to cuddle when she sleeps that's why she likes to lay on
    my face. 

    Mariah also loves to play games. Mariah's favorite game to play is
    fetch! If you throw a hairband to Mariah she will chase after it, and
    bring it right back. Mariah gets so excited when you get the hair bands
    out.

    Mariah's favorit food is kitten chow. Mariah sure does know how to chow
    down on the kitten chow.
